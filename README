This is a near-unmaintained Eggdrop module designed to discourage certain kinds of undesirable behavior. It's not really being modified anymore, nor is it supported for anyone besides me. It's mostly up here for posterity's sake. Consider the code public-domain.

----

Put this directory in Eggdrop's src/mod directory, then build eggdrop like normal.

Add "loadmodule flewder" to your eggdrop.conf.

Note that there are hardcoded strings near the top of both source files (search for "#c++" to find them.) You might want to change those. Yeah, it's kind of nasty.
